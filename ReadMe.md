# Zilio Net - Node Branch

Zilio Net is a simple web site which is designed for demonstrational purposes by David N. Zilio.

This version of the site is desiged to demonstrate:

* Node
* Express
* Pug
* MongoDB

The above technologies are valuable to modern web development. My intent in developing this simple application is to both learn and be able to demonstrate my capabilities in these modern technologies.

I plan to also make a .Net Core And SQL Server version.

All of the technologies I'm building are being built for Ubuntu, the version varies between 16.04LTS and 18.04LTS
